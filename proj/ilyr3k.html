        <h2>Part 0: Wary of Wizards</h2>
        <p>
            I think more folks should have a think about what goes on inside computers. We know what some bits do thanks
            to the gift of UI and UX: they draw silly pictures, play sounds and deliver emails that 
            <a class="link"  href="#emails-ohno" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="emails-ohno-ref">need to be read.</a> 
            These functionalities aren't self-describing, though: we know nothing about how these parts are 
            A modern non-technical person may be familiar with some of the initial details of software, that programs exist
            as little slices of resources alongside an operating system that manages them, but even this is abstracting out 
            the parts that-- in my opinion-- are most mysterious. What does it mean for a program to "run"? 
            It sure as h*ck doesn't have legs, so someone has some explaining to do! Some folks might have heard the term
            "CPU"  before, but what  is it and how can something exist <i>on</i> it? I spent a good few nights Wikipedia 
            diving and researching documentation to this end.

            What I found was tomes of black magic and the speech there was speech of witchcraft and black magic. something something wizards
            <br>
            a skilled group carves magic runes into small particles of special sand, coercing the flow
            of special unseeable particles that power the world? Poppycock! That's ridiculous! Someone's lying 
            and I'll figure out this nonsense myself. Oh, whoops, can't, because silicon fab is sixty bajillion dollars.
