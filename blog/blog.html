                While I do plenty of writing for work, all of it is technical and done for an audience behind big metal doors. 
                I love making a well-crafted  powerpoint as much as the next person, but that can only become so much of a
                creative exercise before your boss takes you off the project. To make up for that I'll be using this space to talk
                openly, freely and without financial risk. Expect plenty of talk about giant robots, video game narratives
                and blogging. Perhaps a pinch of prose every now and then, too.

                I closed the book on <i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i> and was pleasantly surprised to see the new Studio Zero team come out swinging. 
                There were some narrative and mechanical missteps, but in new ways that don't retread issues this team has had before. Overall,
                the game carried itself with sure footing and I happily walked with it on its way.

                <h3>[8-4-2024]</h3>
                I finished up <i>The Sopranos</i> right around the start of the summer, and loved every bite of that spicy meatball. I 
                had to get some thoughts down about that ending. Beyond being incredibly narratively satisfying, I thought that 
                there's a few thematic tricks done in the last five minutes or so that really make the final scene shine.

                <h3>[5-8-2024]</h3>
                This past January, I saw the English premiere of the movie adaptations of <i>Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</i>.
                Those movies gave me a lot to think about; I grew up with the show, and being thrown headfirst into the past 
                like that gave me a chance to reflect on what I love so much about it.

                <h3>[10-1-2023]</h3>
                Inspired by the recent conclusion of <span style="color: red"><i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i></span>, I dedicated
                2023 to <b>The Xenoyear</b>, an excuse to explore the back catalog of the broader <i>Xeno</i> franchise. I
                wrote down my thoughts along the way, and have been trying to condense them into something others can reasonably
                interact with. I'm still working through some of those pieces, but feel free to follow along as I finish them up!
                The Xenoyear posts <a class="link" href="/blog/xenoyear/part0.html">start here</a>, with more to come.
