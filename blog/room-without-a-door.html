        <p>
            I've been blowing in the wind for roughly the past six months. The transition from academics into The Workforce&#8482;
            has had some strings attached logistically: from the spring up until now I've found myself no less than four
            different places to call home, peppered with the occasional visits to my actual home. This has kept me near perpetually on
            wheels. Yet, I've luckily managed to avoid catching a case of that special kind of exhaustion behind the wheel reserved for
            family road trips and holiday <a href="#logan" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="logan-ref">travel.</a> 
            I'll chalk half of that up to the scenery: especially as the trees work their way through fall, the varied and vibrant
            colors of New England Autumn does more than enough to keep me entertained on longer drives. The remaining fifty percent of
            the drive-to-make-the-drive is more difficult to pin down, but sufficient rumination makes me point to the "what" and "where"
            of the drives.
