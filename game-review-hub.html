        This will eventually be the hub for game reviews. Maybe general content reviews? I dunno.
        I just wanna talk.

        This is the hub for game reviews. I'm on the fence if I want to review every single
        thing I play (probably not) or just stuff I develop thoughts worth talking about. After
        my backlog blitz this summer, I'm looking to take games at a slower pace. I've been 
        rushing through stuff, and haven't had time to really chew on anything.
