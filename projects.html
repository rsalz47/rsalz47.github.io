        </h2>

        <p>
            As I mentioned on the landing page, most of my projects focus on some aspect of 
            <a href="#goofy-proj" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="goofy-proj-ref">low-level programming and system design</a>. 
            If I'm working on something particularly involved, I like to accompany it with a blog post on this section of the site.
            I find the best way to internalize concepts is explaining them to 
            <a href="#short-memory" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="short-memory-ref">others</a>, so I make use
            of this part of the site to walk through the ideas in a lecture style. I'm of the opinion that you can't master something
            until you can communicate it to others, so these blog posts are my way of practicing what I preach. Project posts
            usually don't focus on specific implementation details; they exist to explain the theory, the use cases and complications
            that might exist when using a tool or system. In the best case, they act as reference material for others to remix and
            spin off into their own work.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the top of every blog post I  share a link to the relevant repository, so you can see how the ideas I
            explain tie to the code I wrote. I document my work fairly well, between comments in source and READMEs, so
            following along from the codebase shouldn't be much of a challenge. Like most everyone of this persuasion, I
            use GitHub as the central storage platform for all of my public code. I don't necessarily create a blog post
            for every project I do, so sneaking a peek every once in a while couldn't hurt. Who knows, you might even enjoy it.
