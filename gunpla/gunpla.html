            <h2> I build giant robots.</h2>

            <p>
                Okay, maybe that's a little fanciful. I build plastic models of robots, called 
                <a href="#gunpla-name" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="gunpla-name-ref">"gunpla"</a>, 
                that are scaled to either a 1/144, 1/100 or 1/64 size. This may sound small-- and some of the
                simpler kits are indeed hand-size on the bigger end-- but most are appreciably sized, if not  
                <a href="#neo-zeong" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="neo-zeong-ref">actually massive</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                While never quite matching the size of their animated or real
                <a href="#yokohama-gundam" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="yokohama-gundam-ref">world</a> 
                counterparts, gunpla nevertheless encapsulates a lot of outstanding mechanical design and detail even
                at a smaller scale. It's pretty remarkable seeing how components are translated into a scaled-down real world
                equivalent. The real fun begins on top of this pre-existing detail though: gunpla are designed to be customized
                with the only limits being creativity. Kitbashing, airbrushing, and 3D printing are only the start of the
                kinds of things that folks do to make their mobile suits personal. Gunpla combines the satisfaction of handicraft
                with the magnificance of mechanical designs, and I'm not convinced there's much better than that.

                Below, I've organized all the kits I've built by their "grade", which is a general way kit makers describe the
                complexity of a build. I've taken plenty of pictures of builds, both in-progress and completed, customized
                and destroyed, and I'm very eager to share them. I hope you enjoy!

                            The term "gunpla" is actually a simple portmanteau of "<b>Gun</b>dam" and "<b>Pla</b>stic Models".

                            is easily the most famous example of this. Even though it's at 1/144 scale,
                            it stands tall at three feet tall and <i>20 pounds</i> of heft. The thing's a titan-- strictly lower
                            case.

                            There's actually a few to-scale Gundam installations such as the

                            Gundam in person, and it's a magnificent thing.
