                <h2>Hey there. I'm a reverse engineer by trade and a tech junkie by choice.</h2>

                <p>
                    You might've seen me around the net as Swillion.
                    I've got two fancy papers in Computer Science from The University of Massachusetts, Amherst
                    that say I'm certified to sit behind a screen, and I've developed a great deal of
                    expertise in that regard. My professional interests lie in low-level security along the software-hardware line, 
                    with preference tipping slightly towards the 
                    <a href="#sidechannel" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="electrical-ref">former.</a> 
                    I have projects that focus on system design and implementation, such as a software simulation of a 
                    <a href="#cpu" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="cpu-ref">MIPS-1 CPU</a>, a 
                    <a href="#compiler" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="compiler-ref">tree-walk interpreter written in Java</a>, 
                    and a rudimentary kernel. I also think giant robots are pretty damn sick.

                    On the left hand side, you can see a sidebar that helps you navigate to the other slices of my site. The
                    <b>Projects</b> tab contains writeups and repository links for any technical work I think is worth sharing;
                    the <b>Blog</b> tab is for anything I'd like to talk about, whether that be my reaction to a movie I've seen
                    or short story ideas that I want to write down; the <b>Gunpla</b> tab has pictures of my latest hobby, building
                    and customizing plastic models of the aforementioned awesome giant robots. I'll post site updates on this main
                    page, so check in once in a while to see what's new. A little company's always great.

                            I mostly do work in reverse engineering and binary exploitation, rather than focusing on hardware
                            exploits. I'd love to learn more about that stuff someday, though; it's real-life sci-fi stuff.
