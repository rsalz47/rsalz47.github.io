            <p>
                I'm a particularly passionate fan of great big hunks of metal that go ker-chunk in the night. Watching giant humanoid
                figures duke it out with mechanized fists, excessive amounts of artillery, and in the best possible case, 
                <a href="#ttgl" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="ttgl-ref" >galaxies as frisbees</a> is one of the most enlightening
                and awe-inspiring things a person can do. I have a very short list of activities that surpasses watching moving
                metal duke it out, and the most salient item on that list is being able to pilot one of those mechas yourself.

                Despite my best efforts, it doesn't seem like reality has allowed this possibility 
                <a href="#yokohama-gundam" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="yokohama-gundam-ref">quite yet.</a> While that's
                getting sorted out, I've turned to the next best thing: making and customizing models of mecha. In particular, I've
                been doing a deep dive into the grandfather of all mecha, Gundam, and have properly also spent a fair chunk of time
                and money building plastic models of machines showed in the show, called Mobile Suits. Here, you'll find pictures
                of various builds in-progress, posed, customized or destroyed, in hopes that you too will come to understand that
                <i>giant $!%#* robots</i> are rad as hell.
