            <p>
                Over the past few years, I've been interested in paying closer attention to the stuff I read, watch, play and live. 
                Authors, artists and developers put a lot of effort to focus and create the media they worked on; I'm more than
                willing to match some fraction of that and give some thought to what they're putting out. I also just enjoy
                writing down the day-to-day. This is the place where I attempt to organize all that into something presentable.

                half of yesteryear, I've nominated this year of 2023 as an appropriate time to explore Tetsuya Takahashi's vast
