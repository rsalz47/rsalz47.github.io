                While I do plenty of writing for work, all of it is technical and therefore boring. I love making a well-crafted 
                powerpoint as much as the next person, but that can only become so much of a creative exercise before your boss
                takes you off the project. To make up for that, I use this space to talk openly, freely and without financial risk.
                Expect plenty of talk about giant robots, video game narratives and blogging. Perhaps a pinch of creative prose, too.

                Inspired by the recent conclusion of <span style="color: red"><i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i></span>, I dedicated
                2023 to <b>The Xenoyear</b>, an excuse to explore the back catalog of the broader <i>Xeno</i> franchise. I
                wrote down my thoughts along the way, and have been trying to condense them into something others can reasonably
                interact with. I'm still working through some of those pieces, but feel free to follow along as I finish them up!
                The Xenoyear posts <a class="link" href="/src/html/blog/xenoyear/part0.html">start here</a>, with more to come.
