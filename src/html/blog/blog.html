                As someone in a technical field, I've traded in periods and commas for semicolons and... I guess commas too. That's
                maybe not the best analogy, but I think that illustrates my point. These days, I don't have much of a reason to write
                anything besides programs or documentation for them, which leaves my own writing style exact but uninspired.
                While that style can certainly be satisfying, it's really not the most imaginative work. I've always been
                fond of prosiac writing, so I'm using this blog as an excuse to whet my writing.

                I don't plan to center this blog around any particular motif. It's largely here simply as a repository for whatever 
                I feel inclined to both write and share.

                Right now, I'm in the middle of a series of posts focusing on video game analysis. Inspired by the recent conclusion
                of the <span style="color: red"><i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i></span> series in 2022, I've dedicated 2023 to the
                exploring the back catalog of the broader <i>Xeno</i> franchise. You can view the start of this
                <a class="link" href="/src/html/blog/xenoyear/part0.html">series of posts here</a>. I am currently in the middle
                of <span style="color:darkorchid"><i>Xenosaga Episode 2: Jenseits von Gut und BÃ¶se</i></span>. You can jump
                right to its <a class="link" href="/src/html/blog/xenoyear/part3-xenosaga2.html">blog post here</a>.
