                <i>The Castle</i>, Blockchain Chicken, and Char Aznable: My Time at Hacker Summer Camp
            </h1>
    
            <p>
                A few weeks ago, I went to summer camp. Even though Las Vegas lacks any liquid below 20-proof, I learned 
                smart ways of surfing. I also learned carving, how to put out fires, and <i>very</i> effective ways to start
                them. I even broadened my inte

                Before all that could happen though, I had to actually get 
                This past week, I was luckily enough to win a company wide lottery for paid trips to the two most well-known conferences
                in cybersecurity, Blackhat and Defcon. This was an immense privilege that helped me brush shoulders with folks who 
                know too much about what goes on inside these ubiquitous black boxes and gave me an unexpectedly hearty list of new faces
                eager to have a chat whenever our circumferences overlap. I'm very grateful that I was able to go, and can't understate
                my appreciation.
    
                The act of actually getting there fucking sucked. We'll be getting to that soon. 
    
                The initial tabulation of all my hours in transit tallied up to a commute of eight or nine hours. With
    
                For my first solo trip 
                halfway across the country, this was a reasonable trial by fire. 
    
                As reading material for my flight, I brought along Xiaowei Weng's <i>Blockchain Chicken Farm</i>. It explores the incorporation of
                "industry-busting technological innovation" into contemporary rural China and written in a way that evokes a travel diary. Weng details
                their travels
