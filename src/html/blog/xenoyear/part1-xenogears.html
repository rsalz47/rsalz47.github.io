            <h2>Outstretched Hands</h2>

            <p>
                The opening hour of <b><i>Xenogears</i></b> extends a myriad of hands to grab newcomers into its world. It doesn't 
                make this clear at first impression, however. The opening sequence is a breakneck montage of space opera,
                science fiction, spirituality, fictional history, small town drama and giant mecha combat that offers very little
                room to breathe. This vast range of themes and ideas certainly feels intimidating, but actually serves two
                important purposes. It first serves as a concise vertical slice of the narrative elements present in
                <b><i>Xenogears</i></b>. The journey of protagonist Fei Fong Wong et al. traverses some ten-thousand-plus years of 
                history both real and fabricated, deep inside the boundaries of themselves and far outside the bounds of 
                their universe. Thus, it provides the ten thousand foot view of what <b><i>Xenogears</i></b> will
                delve into over its seventy five hour runtime.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second purpose runs ancillary to the first. It is clear that <b><i>Xenogears</i></b> requires attunement to a
                very specific wavelength. The main narrative of the game requires consistent engagement and extensive
                dedicated headspace. This is not an easy ask. Put lightly, it is not for everyone, and more severely it is a
                sign of a needlessly complex and esoteric plot. The extensive variety in the game's opening sequence, while
                certainly exhibiting this very problem, nevertheless attempts to assuage it: with so many elements thrown at the
                player, it's likely they will grab onto <i>something</i>. Perhaps it's the cozy Celtic atmosphere of Lahan Village;
                maybe the character intrigue as a bride-to-be bemoans not marrying the person she truly 
                <a href="#great-taste" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="great-taste-ref">loved.</a> It is true that
                an appreciable amount of those initial ideas will bounce off a person. But when you're throwing the whole
                kitchen at someone, something is bound to be to their taste.
            </p>

            <p>
                And for those who do manage to take the plunge, who accept that hand outstretched and dive into a 
                meticulous universe spanning the beginning of human history to the outlet of eternity, what you will find there
                is a narrative unrivalled in depth and unparalleled in grandeur.
