            <h2>Outstretched Hands</h2>

            <p>
                The opening hour of <b><i>Xenogears</i></b> extends a myriad of hands to grab newcomers into its world. It doesn't 
                make this clear at first impression, however. The opening sequence is a breakneck montage of space opera,
                science fiction, spirituality, fictional history, small town drama and giant mecha combat that offers very little
                room to breathe. To me, this intimidatingly vast range of concepts serves two important purposes.
                It first serves as a concise vertical slice of the narrative elements present in
                <b><i>Xenogears</i></b>. The journey of protagonist Fei Fong Wong et al. traverses some ten-thousand-plus years of 
                history both real and fabricated, deep inside the boundaries of themselves and far outside the bounds of 
                their universe. This opening hour serves as the ten thousand foot view of <b><i>Xenogears</i></b> will delve
                into over its seventy five hour runtime.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second purpose runs ancillary to the first, though that's not immediately clear. <b><i>Xenogears</i></b>
                makes it immediately clear that it requires an appreciable amount of dedicated headspace to keep its game
                This issue is heightened by the scope of the game: it is easy
                 It is clear that <b><i>Xenogears</i></b> requires attunement to a
                very specific wavelength. The main narrative of the game requires consistent engagement and extensive
                dedicated headspace. This is not an easy ask. Put lightly, it is not for everyone, and more severely it is a
                sign of a needlessly complex and esoteric plot. The extensive variety in the game's opening sequence, while
                certainly exhibiting this very problem, nevertheless attempts to assuage it: with so many elements thrown at the
                player, it's likely they will grab onto <i>something</i>. It could be the comfortable atmosphere of Lahan Village
                draped in the warm blanket of Yasunori Mitsuda's Celtic music; perhaps it's the initial character intrigue
                regarding an upcoming village wedding, where an otherwise cheerful day gets undercut by requited but 
                purposefully unmentioned emotions.
            </p>

            <p>
                All of this is <i>a lot</i>. A player could feel overwhelmed and understandably bounce off such a broad
                scope of ideas. My first impressions almost fell along these lines, too: the transition from hard sci-fi to a slow
                text crawl about medieval politics into small town drama did feel like being dragged around from place to place
                rather aggressively at times. However, now that I'm on the other side of it all, I retrospect on those opening 
                moments more charitably. The opening moments are certainly chaotic and busy, but not to confound a newcomer.
                I didn't feel like a thousand hands were throwing a thousand concepts at my face for intimidation, but rather
                presenting these ideas as offerings.
            </p>

            <p>
                And for others who do manage to take the plunge as well, who accept the offers of those hands, 
                I believe that what they'll find there is a narrative unrivalled in depth and unparalleled in grandeur.
            </p>

            <h2>Mechanics</h3>

            <p>
                The mechanical body of <b><i>Xenogears</i></b> is largely familiar. It features most of the usual trappings of a 
                turn-based RPG: cities, towns, villages and dungeons dotted up and down and all around a wide open world. It also
                has the expected combat system with physical attacks, magic attacks with an associated currency, armor to equip and
                items to use. In addition to the familiar face, though, the combat system is also outfitted with the first of 
                <b><i>Xenogears</i></b>'s interesting innovations. In place of a single attack option, each character is alloted 
                points per turn to spend on light, medium and heavy attacks. 
            </p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">

                </div>
            <p>
                The game actively encourages experimentation and exploration of this combo system by layering on deathblow techniques,
                specific attack routes that culminate in a strong finisher. Deathblows aren't merely level up rewards; they require
                characters to learn and discover them on their own by practicing combo strings. I found that this created a wonderful
                harmony between the player's mindset and the character: a player is naturally driven to find the most optimal
                attack combinations to succeed in battles; the characters' mindset in universe would naturally mimic this mindset as
                their journey faces them against many a foe. Thus, these deathblows are both rewards inside the universe of the game
                as well as on a meta level for the player.
            </p>

            <p>
                The other innovation layers even further on top of the combat system, and indeed every other aspect of the game: 
                at any point in battles or on the world map, you can enter Gears, giant robots that can do
