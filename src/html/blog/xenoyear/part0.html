            <h1>The Xenoyear Part 0 - Familiar and Foreign</h1>

            <hr>

            <p>
                I grew up on games that often fell into the camp of "big on text, turn based in gameplay," especially if they 
                happen to be some form of JRPG. I've spent plenty of time by that fire and roamed around the JRPG genre with its
                prominent representatives: the modern <i>Personas</i>, <i>Fire Emblems</i>, and <i>Golden Suns</i>; <i>Earthbound</i>,
                <i>Chrono Trigger</i>, <i>Radiant Historia</i> and
                <a href="#blitzball" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="blitzball-ref"><i>Final Fantasy X</i></a>.
                I've thus become well acquainted with a lot of the standard tropes these narratives rely on: often feudal settings,
                young adolescents, power of teamwork, magic swords, the final boss is god. This is a well-worn path that I have
                made my way down many times. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2015, through strong encouragement of a friend, I picked up a copy of 
                <a href="#3ds" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="3ds-ref "><i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i></a>.
                The footprint of <i>Xenoblade</i> mimicked ones left by the other games I've played in many ways:
                the Monado, key symbol of this game, is one of the most magic of swords; the final boss
                most certainly is some sort of divine; many monster designs could be supplanted fairly easily into a more traditional
                high fantasy setting. The bones of <i>Xenoblade</i> was not something wholly unfamiliar to me.
            </p>

            <p>
                And yet, when I played it, I found these tropes transformed in ways that were as yet unseen to me. The game's cast
                starts out as a handful of 18 year olds, sure, but the average age grows steadily with party size, ending up with a
                well-rounded group of characters each with unique perspectives on the narrative's events. While "the super power
                of teamwork" is certainly present within the story, its use is elevated from a cliche to a message about what it takes 
                to break recurrent cycles of violence. Even the Monado wraps itself so tightly into the foundations of
                <i>Xenoblade</i>'s worldbuilding that writing it off as a basic trope discredits the work as a whole. From a ten
                thousand foot perspective, I find that <i>Xenoblade</i> uses all the JRPG tropes to their utmost potential. I have a
                very hard time finding ways to speak higher of it.
            </p>

            <p>
                It comes as no surprise that I was ecstatic when <i>Xenoblade</i> then evolved into a series with the release of its
                sequel and its subsequent critical success.  As of now, there are three main games developed by Monolith Softare, each
                of which is predictably named <i>Xenoblade Chronicles 1</i>, <i>2</i> and 
                <a href="#xcx" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="xcx-ref"><i>3</i></a>. 
                While my appreciation for the other two entries is a little rockier compared
                <a href="#xc2-sux" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="xc2-sux-ref">to the first</a>, I'm confident in saying that 
                each of these games are more than worth your time. Beyond each game's core experience, side campaign a year or so after
                its launch that further develop the narratives of their respective game as well as tie together the three
                seemingly-disjoint mainline entries: <i>Xenoblade 1</i> has <i>Future Connected</i>, <i>Xenoblade 2</i> has
                <i>Torna: The Golden Country</i>, and the most recent game, <i>Xenoblade 3</i> received its side story
                <i>Future Redeemed</i> just this past spring, in April 2023. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Compared to the other two side stories, <i>Future Redeemed</i> stands somewhat separate than the other two. Instead of
                enhancing solely the narrative of <i>Xenoblade 3</i> as the other two do with <i>1</i> and <i>2</i>, 
                <i>Future Redeemed</i> focuses on a much larger scope. It is less an expansion for <i>Xenoblade 3</i> specifically as it
                is an expansion of the entire series up until that point. It weaves together plot threads that were first laid back
                in the very first game, closing the book on the overarching narrative built up over the past decade. While there may be 
                <a class="link" href="xenoblade-continues" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="#xenoblade-continues-ref">
                    more to come
                </a>, 
                <i>Future Redeemed</i> serves as an impeccable ending to the past ten years of storytelling.
            </p>

            <p>
                As such a passionate fan of the series I decided to take the entire year of 2023 and examine the broader context
                of the <i>Xeno</i> franchise. While containerized, the <i>Xenoblade</i> series is really only the most recent 
                incarnation of a recurring spiral of science fiction, high fantasy, and philosophy. Starting back in 1997,
                <i>Xenogears</i> began a wild ride melding together Freudian psychology, Kabbalistic mysticism, hard science fiction
                and Christian religious inspiration. While future <i>Xeno</i> entries reduce their scope somewhat, judeo-christian
                theming blending into science fiction remains a staple of the series.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the time of writing, there are now seven games under the <i>Xeno</i> umbrella: <i>Xenogears</i>, 
                <i>Xenosaga Episode 1: Zur Wille dur Macht</i>, <i>Xenosaga Episode 2: Jenseits von Gut und BÃ¶se</i>, 
                <i>Xenosaga Episode 3: Also Sprach Zarathustra</i> and the four <i>Xenoblade</i> games. Since I'm already
                intimately familiar with the <i>Xenoblade</i> games, I'll be focusing my attention on the four games that come
                before it. As I work through each, I'll be sharing my thoughts, opinions, criticisms and congratulations in dedicated
                blog posts, just like this one.

                            The 3DS version, specifically. Even there, I found the game's visual fidelity and scope 
                            breathtaking. Whether that speaks to the capabilities of the 3DS or however low my threshold
                            for good graphics may be, I'll leave that for you to decide.

                            There's actually a black sheep of a fourth game, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i>. It has strange standing
                            in the series, as it adopts an entirely different style and story from everything else, and is likewise
                            the most niche. It's very clearly not a part of the mainline canon, and I won't be treating it as such 
                            in this project.

                            Particularly <i>Xenoblade 2</i>. I'll get around to summarizing my thoughts and feelings on it 
                            at some point after this project, but my first impressions were overwhelming disappointment at everything
                            but the gameplay, graphical fidelity and soundtrack. The final 10 hours were the sole exception, as every
                            aspect of the game suddenly became (undeservedly?) excellent.

                            In some interviews, series creator Tetsuya Takashi has said that the broader <i>Xenoblade</i>
                            franchise may have <a class="link" href="https://shorturl.at/eyEPZ">more to come down the line</a>, but it 
                            won't have ties to the core narrative the first three games center around.
