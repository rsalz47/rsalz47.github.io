            <p>
                I grew up on games that often fell into the camp of "big on text, turn based in gameplay," especially if they 
                happen to be some form of JRPG. I've spent plenty of time by that fire and roamed around the JRPG genre with its
                prominent representatives: the modern <i>Personas</i>, <i>Fire Emblems</i>, and <i>Golden Suns</i>; <i>Earthbound</i>,
                <i>Chrono Trigger</i>, <i>Radiant Historia</i> and
                <a href="#blitzball" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="blitzball-ref"><i>Final Fantasy X</i></a>.
                I've thus become well acquainted with a lot of the standard tropes these narratives rely on: often feudal settings,
                young adolescents, power of teamwork, magic swords, the final boss is god. This is a well-worn path that I have
                made my way down many times. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2015, through strong encouragement of a friend, I picked up a copy of 
                <a href="#3ds" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="3ds-ref "><i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i></a>.
                The footprint of <i>Xenoblade</i> mimicked ones left by the other games I've played in many ways:
                the Monado, key symbol of this game, is one of the most magic of swords; the final boss
                most certainly is some sort of divine; many monster designs could be supplanted fairly easily into a more traditional
                high fantasy setting. The bones of <i>Xenoblade</i> was not something wholly unfamiliar to me.
            </p>

            <p>
                And yet, when I played it, I found these tropes transformed in ways that were as yet unseen to me. The game's cast
                starts out as a handful of 18 year olds, sure, but the average age grows steadily with party size, ending up with a
                well-rounded group of characters each with unique perspectives on the narrative's events. While "the super power
                of teamwork" is certainly present within the story, its use is elevated from a cliche to a message about what it takes 
                to break recurrent cycles of violence. Even the Monado, by all accounts another Excalibur-type literary device, wraps
                itself so tightly into the foundations of <i>Xenoblade</i>'s worldbuilding that writing it off as a basic trope
                discredits the work as a whole. From a ten thousand foot perspective, I find that <i>Xenoblade</i> uses all the JRPG
                tropes to their utmost potential. I have a very hard time finding ways to speak higher of it.
            </p>

            <p>
                It comes as no surprise that I was ecstatic when <i>Xenoblade</i> evolved into a series with the release of its sequel
                and subsequent critical success. While I have a much rockier relationship with latter entries compared 
                <a href="#xc2-sux" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="xc2-sux-ref">to the first</a>, I'm nonetheless still a 
                passionate fan. The most recent entry, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed</i>, celebrates the series's run 
                over the past twelve years and weaves together threads strung throughout the previous three entries. It's meant
                to be a capstone on where the <i>Xenoblade</i> series has gone and takes the very best from everything before it.
            </p>

            <p>
                I decided to follow suit with this trend. I dedicated the year of <i>Future Redeemed</i>'s release, 2023, as 
                <b>The Xenoyear</b>. <b>The Xenoyear</b> is an excuse to explore the larger <i>Xeno</i> franchise, the brainchild
                of Tetsuya Takahashi. <i>Xenoblade</i> is simply the most recent iterations of themes and concepts that Takahashi
                has worked with since the franchise's inception in 1997. The franchise has recurringly circled around Gnostic and 
                Nietzschean philosophies and has an ever-present blend of religion, science fiction, and fantasy. While each
                installment is disjoint from one another, I believe that there's something to gain by walking through the entire
                history of the <i>Xeno</i> franchise, starting with the cult classic <i>Xenogears</i> in 1997.

                reactions and appreciations for everything up to <i>Xenoblade Chronicles 1</i>: <i>Xenogears</i>, 
                <i>Xenosaga Episode 1: Zur Wille dur Macht</i>, <i>Xenosaga Episode 2: Jenseits von Gut und BÃ¶se</i> and

                            The 3DS version, specifically. Even there, I found the game's visual fidelity and scope 
                            breathtaking. Whether that speaks to the capabilities of the 3DS or however low my threshold
                            for good graphics may be, I'll leave that for you to decide.

                            Particularly <i>Xenoblade 2</i>. I'll get around to summarizing my thoughts and feelings on it 
                            at some point after this project, but my first impressions were overwhelming disappointment at everything
                            but the gameplay, appearance and soundtrack. The final 10 hours were the sole exception, and almost 
                            undeservedly excellent.
