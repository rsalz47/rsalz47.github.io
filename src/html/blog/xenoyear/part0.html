            <p>
                Most of the games I played growing up fell into the camp of big on text and turn based in gameplay. While I didn't
                grow up on the archetypal Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest directly, I certainly walked a parallel path in 
                the Bravely Default, Fire Emblem and Persona franchises. As a result, I got well acquainted with the classic tropes
                of many Japanese RPG stories: often feudal settings, young adolescents, power of teamwork, evil cults, the final boss is god. 
                This is a well-worn path and I've made my way down it many times.
