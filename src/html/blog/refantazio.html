                There is very little more you need to know about <i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i> than the fact it has Count Louis Guiabern. He is the very first 
                character presented to the audience, and from the short minute of introduction he grants you it should be immediately clear why he is 
                so appealing. A confident, cocky, controlled and conventionally attractive antagonistic force who simply does not care about you-- yet,
                in his absence, you can't stop hearing about how every character care about him. Despite being backgrounded for the first half of the story
                Louis exists as this persistent presence that only gets amplified when he becomes a direct player in the plot. At times, it feels like the 
                game centers itself around him as its shining star; a bold task in an already gleaming game.

                And yeah, beyond the noble Count himself, there's a lot to <i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i> that makes it sparkle.
