                There is very little more you need to know about <i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i> than the fact it has Count Louis Guiabern. He is the very first 
                character presented to the audience, and from the short minute of introduction he grants you it should be immediately clear why he is 
                so appealing. A confident, cocky, controlled and conventionally attractive antagonistic force who simply does not care about you-- yet,
                in his absence, you can't stop hearing about how every character care about him. Despite being backgrounded for the first half of the story
                Louis exists as this persistent presence that only gets amplified when he becomes a direct player in the plot. At times, it feels like the 
                game centers itself around him as its shining star; a bold task in an already gleaming game.
            </p>

            <p>
                And yeah, beyond the noble Count himself, there's a lot to <i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i> that makes it sparkle.

            <p>
                Atlus has cut away a very competent mechanical middle ground between the modern <i>Persona</i> and <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i> styles of combat.
            </p>

            <p>
                The inspiration of the former is felt through the generally fast pace of combat. Many encounters in <i>Persona</i> are accurately called puzzle-like:
                they focus on using the baton pass mechanic to knock down as many enemies in one turn as possible, setting up for an ideally enemy-wiping All-Out Attack.
                <i>Metaphor</i> follows a very similar one-turn flow: there are a great many skills in the game that are focused on making enemies vulnerable to elements
                they wouldn't be otherwise. Additionally, while there aren't All-Out Attacks this time around, many of the multi-target magic spells are locked behind the
                collaborative Synthesis mechanics, which I felt echoed the novelty of All-Out Attacks. Both of these combined made me fall into the same "set em up, knock
                em down" style of playing as I did in <i>Persona</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <i>Shin Megami Tensei</i> influence is felt through the restrictions placed on player ability in combat. <i>Metaphor</i> inherits the fiendishly
                delightful Press Turn system. Instead of being guaranteed that each of your party members will act once a turn, you are instead alloted four Press Turn
                icons. Most actions consume one icon, meaning a regular party would act four times before changing turns to the enemy. However, attack effectiveness and
                accuracy can affect this: hitting an enemy's weakness grants an additional action, allowing for two full rotations through the party before switching
                turns. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Conversely, the player pays a price for swingly blindly. If an enemy strongly resists or dodges an attack, then a player could lose multiple
                icons or their entire turn. As such, the order of operations becomes a much heavier focus. In order to gain more actions you will want to probe 
                the enemy for weaknesses, but choosing poorly could prematurely end a turn before having an opportunity to properly set your party up.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Metaphor</i> also sports a couple of completely fresh additions that can't be traced back to either sister series, the first being the introduction
                of a class-based progression system. Party members notably do not gain skills by leveling up normally as is the cause with many other RPGs. Instead,
                characters gain proficiences in individual Archetypes. Archetypes can be thought of a template for combat roles: there are Archetypes for swordfighters,
                for mages, for healers and thieves. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There are explicit incentives to play around with party Archetype composition. The aforementioned Synthesis skills require specific Archetype
                combinations to be present in battle to execute, and executing them may require moving a dedicated physical attacker into a buff-focused support 
                role to pull off; the game doesn't penalize you for this, though. Archetypes have the ability to inherit skills from other classes, allowing 
                party members in an off-role to still fulfill their original niche, if a little less effectively. Additionally, every party member can learn
                every archetype without any penalty, so there is little reason not to get creative.
            </p>

                            Combination techniques did also exist in the Digital Devil Saga duology, sure, but I gloss over that fact here
                            because they're not a part of mainline SMT nor implemented quite the same way.
