            January was a minor milestone for fans of giant robots. For the first time ever,
            the two-movie adaptation of <i>Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</i> received a U.S. theatrical screening.
            The first movie-- a compilation of the first half of the anime-- aired the week of the 16th and the second one-- notably 
            more original than the first-- followed the week after. These showings were significant: prior to this, the movies
            had only existed in expensive blu-ray collections and barely-seeded torrents. They certainly were significant to me, at 
            the very least. It had been quite some time since I last gave much thought to <i>Gurren Lagann</i> and even longer
            since I had rewatched it last. I quickly made these movies a priority in my schedule once I heard the news.
            <i>Gurren Lagann</i> is a show I continue to hold in a very special spot in my heart, and release of these movies
            had me start thinking about why that is.
        </p>

        <p>
            These movies reminded me that I've committed <i>Gurren Lagann</i> to a very special spot in my heart, and provided me
            with the opportunity to start thinking about why that is. Looking retrospectively, it is perhaps the most obvious
            thing in the world that I hold this show in exceptionally high regard. As a young kid, I grew up on a lot of
            big mech action shows and franchises. I was a huge <i>Bioncle</i> fan; watched a(n un)healthy amount of Michael Bay
            <i>Transformers</i> movies; gulped down the yearly Power Rangers installment with a side of 
            <a href="#srmthfg" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="srmthfg-ref"><i>Super Robot Monkey Team Hyper Force Go.</i></a>
            The bag of tricks was on the table, so I thought. I was well saturated with the concepts of love, teamwork and
            friendship and the way their powers combined paved the way to victory. 
        </p>

        <p>
            "Perhaps <i>too</i> well saturated," I said to myself, jaded and cold at the world, sitting in my early middle school homeroom.
            I can't talk about this stuff when I <s>play</s> hang out with my friends any more. I couldn't be caught 
            dead interacting with that bright and shiny, music blaring, engine whirring stuff <i>fifth graders</i> watched.
            I had to establish my more mature taste inmedia: Shadow the Hedgehog, <i>Maximum Ride</i> and <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i>.
            Besides, I had my fill of all that colorful stuff when I was younger. I obviously had seen everything Saturday morning
            cartoons had to offer, western or otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, I had not yet seen <i>Gurren Lagann</i>.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            It took a decent amount of legwork for this show to enter my awareness. It started in the comments of Jontron's video
            about <i>King's Quest V</i>, with people insulting each other by saying they probably watched "X show by Aniplex". I had never
            heard of this "aniplex" before, but it sure sounded similar to something TeamFourStar would say in one of their DBZA episodes.
            So began a Google goose chase through many a webring  until I stumbled upon some version of proto Crunchyroll or KissAnime,
            don't remember which. Then and only then did I see this foreign "Aniplex" associated with a series of twenty seven bright, shiny
            thumbnails decorated in blues, crimsons and golds. I stood no chance; no amount of Sonic Adventure 2 Shadow AMVs could pull
            me away, no matter how hard I posed. Thus, I poked my head through that little window on my computer screen and fell down, down,
            down into the underground Giha Village.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first episode of <i>Gurren Lagann</i> develops a strong sense of confinement and restriction. Giha Village is small, dangerous and 
            claustrophobic, bound by a low stone ceiling. The placement deep within the earth offers no stability, as semifrequent earthquakes
            cause cave-ins and the tragedies associated with that. The village chief is imposing and domineering, he himself chained to a food
            and energy supply that never quite seems enough to feel comfortable with. This is a setting defined by its limits. It is confining
            and leaves no room for anything but bodies.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the environment our main character Simon was born and raised in. Simon's parents had passed some time prior
            to the show in an earthquake, leaving him alone as the runt of the village. Simon's only talent in the eyes of others
            is his capacity for digging, for burrowing ever further beneath the village and putting as much distance as he can between him
            and everyone else. Both physically and emotionally, Simon begins the story at the lowest possible point he could be. Yet,
            as the obvious idiom goes, when you're at rock bottom, the only direction left is upward.
        </p>

        <p>
            At least, so preaches the village ne'er-do-well, the loud-mouthed and hot-blooded older teenager Kamina. Kamina parades
            aroud Giha Village, preaching of a world beyond the dome.
        </p>

        <p>
            The journey from that point onward is laser focused on depicting just how high a person can go. First the cast broaches the surface;
            then 
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            It <i>was</i>, however, the first anime that I developed the special middle-school-exclusive brand of hyper obsession 
            with. 
            I'd constantly repeat quotes from the show both in real life and online; I had a pair of Kamina's shades that I 
            would wear around to hanging out with friends; I mained Rumble in League of 
            <a href="#league" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="league-ref">Legends</a> solely because one of 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6f8tjtJZVE" class="link">his skins</a> was a reference; I even made a cape 
            in the fashion of Team Dai-Gurren. I fell headfirst into that shit, and I fell <i>hard</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Into high school and beyond, the series eventually left my purview. I had a lot of stuff going on
        </p>

        <p>
            Doubting myself? It's happened a lot. And it will happen a lot. But it'll never be an excuse for me to stop. Who
            the hell do you think I am?

                        Hey, quick question, what the <i>fuuuck</i> was this show? Does anyone else remember
                        it, and could someone explain why the voice cast for it was so insane?

                        Kari Walgren the voice of Haruka Harahara from FLCL,
